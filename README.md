## About Me
After spending five years in South Korea as an ESL teacher, I discovered my enthusiasm for education and the joy of helping others learn. My time abroad not only enriched my understanding of different cultures but also deepened my commitment to making education accessible and enjoyable. 

My goal is to leverage my technical skills to develop applications that make learning fun and interactive. Whether it’s through gamified experiences or intuitive interfaces, I aim to inspire others to embark on their learning journeys. 

**I'm currently on the look out for a role in fullstack web development. If you're hiring, let's chat!**
